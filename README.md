<h1> This project is about progress </h1>

<p>
Diana, is a warrior of life! Like many others, she has overcome many obstacles that most
people never see in their lifetime.  Because of that, she must prove to herself that what
she reads about and what she believes is true; She must prove to herself that her dreams, even
though from long ago, can still come true. And, that despite what is immediately apparent,
she can still learn and still make her dream a reality.
</p>

<p>She has three sons. You can say she was a teen mom. And she is so proud of them.  Because she is
forever their star, she has also determined that her legacy to them is to never give up regardless of
circumstances, regardless of others opinions, regardless of the sacrifices needed to be made to achieve
a goal.</p>

<p>...but for now the writer must get some sleep!...lol</p>
